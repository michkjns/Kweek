# Kweek

Kweek (pronounced: quake), is quite simply put a Quake rip-off based on my software rasterizer, and thereby combining two courses (Graphics Programming and Network Programming), made in my second year of International Game Architecture & Design.

Due to licensing, I have not submitted any assets or dependencies. This is purely for code demonstration.
