# Kweek

Kweek (pronounced: quake), is quite simply put a Quake rip-off based on my software rasterizer, and thereby combining two courses (Graphics Programming and Network Programming), made in my second year of International Game Architecture & Design.

Due to licensing, I have not submitted any assets or dependencies. This is purely for code demonstration.

The aim of this project was to learn about multiplayer networking for real-time action games, and though implementation-wise there is a lot of room for improvement, this project has tought me many of the ideas and patterns involved in creating a real-time multiplayer experience which are certainly helping me in more recent projects.
Creating the software renderer I learned about basic graphics pipelines, how to maintain a solid architecture for clear data ownership and the creation of a basic scenegraph with a child and parent node hierarchy.
